# 100 Days of Code - Programming Challenge

Welcome to the 100 Days of Code - Programming Challenge! This project is a collection of daily programming code snippets written in various programming languages. The challenge is to code every day for 100 days and explore different languages and concepts.

## Motivation

The purpose of this project is to enhance programming skills, learn new languages, and strengthen problem-solving abilities. By practicing daily coding, participants can develop a habit of consistent learning and improve their understanding of programming languages.

## Rules

1. Code every day for 100 days, without any breaks.
2. Each day, write code in a different programming language.
3. Document your code and provide explanations where necessary.
4. Commit your code to this repository or create a separate repository for each day's code.
5. Feel free to share your progress on social media with the hashtag #100DaysOfCode.

## Languages

The challenge covers a wide range of programming languages, including but not limited to:

- C
- C++
- Java
- Python
- JavaScript
- Ruby
- Go
- Rust
- Swift
- PHP
- Kotlin
- TypeScript
- and more...

## Code Structure

Each day's code will be organized in its own directory, following the naming convention `dayX`, where `X` represents the day number. Inside each directory, you will find the code file(s) along with a `README.md` file that provides an explanation of the code and any relevant details.

Feel free to explore the code, run it on your local machine, and experiment with modifications or improvements.
